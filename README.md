# LigharS

LigharS is a raytracing hardware-software system which serves as my senior design project at UCI. It is based on an trimmed version of RISC-V architecture implementing the RV32IMF instruction subset and allocate dedicated threads for the computation for each pixel output.

## Project structure

[`src`](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/tree/main/src) and [`include`](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/tree/main/include) stores the referential software implementation of our raytracing algorithm and utilities. The programs can be compiled and run to give an output image for validation. [`hw`](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/tree/main/hw) contains the hardware implementation detail in Verilog and [`hw/tb`](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/tree/main/hw/tb) contains testbench codes used in early stages of development. [`scripts`](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/tree/main/scripts) sits utility scripts and [a Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/blob/main/scripts/instruction-type-audition.ipynb) used in early prototyping of our compiler. You can learn more about the compiler script [here](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/blob/main/scripts/README.md). The fully developed compiler script is [`scripts/compile-shader.py`](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/blob/main/scripts/compile-shader.py). The shader sources to be compiles are situated in [`assets`](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/tree/main/assets), and the logic of shader compilation is described in great detail in [the `assets` README](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/LigharS/blob/main/assets/README.md).
